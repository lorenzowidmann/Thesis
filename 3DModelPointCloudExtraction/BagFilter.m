%% Loop closure on an already-processed FAST-LIO bag
%
% PROBLEM IT SOLVES
% /cloud_registered is the output of FAST-LIO, so the points are already in
% the map frame BUT with the drift baked into the transforms. The typical
% symptom is a flat corridor that "rises" several meters in the map.
%
% APPROACH
% 1. Poses are read from /Odometry
% 2. The clouds are brought back to the body frame by inverting the pose (un-transform)
% 3. Keyframes are selected
% 4. Loops are searched with Scan Context
% 5. Loops are verified with ICP, discarding false positives
% 6. A pose graph is built with sequential + loop constraints
% 7. It is optimized and the map is reconstructed with the corrected poses

% intersections/T-junctions are more reliable for loop closure (revisitable
% from multiple directions), straight stretches are the category at risk of
% false positives from repetitive structure (doors, evenly spaced columns).
% The paper's ground/obstacle segmentation is NOT done here: cumulative
% rotation is used as a proxy instead (dAng, as in Section 5, but between
% consecutive keyframes) over a window of adjacent keyframes, to capture
% turns spread over several steps and not just single jumps.

%% 6c. YAW drift correction on the wall direction
% The floor constrains only 2 of 3 DOF: the normal of a horizontal plane is
% invariant to rotation about the vertical axis, so it tells "up" but not
% "north". Yaw remains free to drift, and the symptom is that corridors no
% longer meet at right angles in plan.
%
% The reference for yaw is the WALLS: the near-horizontal normals are taken
% and their dominant azimuth is computed, folded modulo 90 degrees (so the
% four sides of an orthogonal corridor fall on the same value). The
% correction brings that azimuth back to the reference value.
%
% WARNING, this is NOT a pure measurement like the floor: it assumes the
% building has a coherent dominant direction (parallel or perpendicular
% walls). If the building really had a wing at 45 degrees, this correction
% would wrongly straighten it, falsifying the geometry. Always check the two
% control prints: if the dispersion does NOT drop clearly, the walls do not
% belong to a single orthogonal family and the assumption does not hold for
% this building: in that case, disable it.

% Section 8 is the INITIAL guess for ICP on the loop candidates. With the
% raw Z drift (up to ~1.8 m on this dataset) inside that initial guess, ICP
% can end up outside the convergence basin on candidates that are otherwise
% valid (see the Section 8 comment on "Tinit too far off"). Correcting here
% gives ICP a better starting estimate; the constraint in the pose graph
% (Section 9) is still useful to defend this height during loop optimization.
%
% Note: after leveling roll/pitch (6b), the rotations in 6c are pure
% rotation about Z (yaw): they do not mix the Z component of translation, so
% applying this correction here (after 6c) instead of before gives the same
% numerical result, with less risk of interfering with the re-integration
