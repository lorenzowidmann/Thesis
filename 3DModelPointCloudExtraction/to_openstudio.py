"""Build an OpenStudio model (.osm) from fit_boxes.py's boxes.json.

Replaces the old fit_planes.py/planes.json version of this script: input is
now a set of axis-aligned BOXES (one Space per room, tiled from several
touching boxes), not individually RANSAC-fit wall/floor/ceiling planes.

GROUPING: boxes share a room via their "hall" field (fit_boxes.py's room
id, preserved through interactive_boxes.py edits) -- every box with the
same "hall" becomes surfaces inside ONE OpenStudio Space (+ ThermalZone).
A box with no "hall" field falls back to being its own single-box room
(printed as a warning -- shouldn't happen from fit_boxes.py's own output).

TOUCHING *OR OVERLAPPING* BOXES ARE OPEN TO EACH OTHER, WHETHER OR NOT
THEY'RE THE SAME ROOM -- no Wall surface is ever created at an edge where
another box is right there, regardless of whether that other box is in the
same "hall" or a different one, and regardless of whether it merely touches
that face or straddles it (boxes that interpenetrate). This matters even
across rooms: fit_boxes.py can split
one physically continuous corridor into two "rooms" over nothing more than
a slight, spurious ceiling-height reading at one point (see its
--height-group-tol) -- inserting a real wall there would seal off an open
passage that doesn't exist in the building. So the rule for every box's 4
vertical edges is simply:

  - edge covered by ANY other box's volume just outside it (same room or
    not, touching or overlapping) -> no surface at all; the two spaces
    stay physically open to each other there.
  - edge covered by nothing (no other box reaches it at all) -> a normal
    exterior Wall (Outdoors/SunExposed/WindExposed).

Rooms therefore only affect which OpenStudio Space/ThermalZone a surface
belongs to (for floor area/volume bookkeeping and later HVAC assignment in
OpenStudio) -- there is no thermal separation between touching rooms
unless you edit the model afterwards (or remove/re-tile boxes to actually
close that opening with real geometry).

Every box also gets a Floor (z_min, "Ground") and RoofCeiling (z_max,
"Outdoors") surface, EXCEPT when that slab lies strictly inside another
box's volume (see is_buried_slab) -- an overlapping box would otherwise
leave a floor/ceiling plate cutting through the middle of an open space.
Coplanar slabs of neighbouring boxes are NOT filtered: OpenStudio has no
problem with a room's floor made of several coplanar rectangles, and
skipping that filtering avoids needing full polygon-union geometry for
possibly non-rectangular (L/T-shaped) room footprints.

Usage:
    python to_openstudio.py [--boxes SavedBoxes/boxes.json]
        [--out OpenStudioModel/<timestamp>.osm] [--name Building]
        [--eps 0.03] [--no-snap]

Output goes to OpenStudioModel/ next to this script by default, named after
the moment it's saved (yy-MM-dd - HH-mm-ss.osm, same convention as
LoopClosure_vFinal's SavedBag/ and SavedBoxes/), so repeated runs never
overwrite each other; the directory is created if missing.

SNAPPING (on by default, see snap_box_coordinates): edges dragged by hand
in interactive_boxes.py rarely land back on fit_boxes.py's exact
--cell-size grid, so two boxes meant to touch can end up with a hairline
gap or overlap between them instead of sharing an exact coordinate. Before
building anything, every box edge within --eps of another gets nudged onto
one shared value -- so boxes that were meant to touch DO touch exactly:
no sliver gap in the floor/ceiling, and build_wall_segments' own --eps
tolerance (used for wall-adjacency detection, same value) has less to
paper over. --no-snap uses --boxes's coordinates completely as-is.

Venv: C:\\venvs\\planefit (same as fit_boxes.py; `pip install openstudio`
added there -- openstudio 3.9+ has cp312/cp313 wheels, unlike open3d).
