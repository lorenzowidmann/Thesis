%% Map correction on an already-processed FAST-LIO bag, WITHOUT loop closure
%
% Variant of LoopClosure_v2.m that entirely removes loop search/verification
% (Scan Context + ICP + loop constraints in the pose graph) and uses ONLY:
%   - the gravity constraint (attitude realignment on the floor + gravity
%     factor in the pose graph)
%   - the temporal constraints (trajectory window cut, truncation at the
%     first implausible odometry/speed divergence)
%   - the other drift corrections not based on loops (yaw on the walls,
%     Z height directly from the floor)
% In addition it adds an outlier removal filter (statistical, pcdenoise),
% both at the single-keyframe level and on the final reconstructed map.
%
% APPROACH
% 1. Poses are read from /Odometry
% 2. The clouds are brought back to the body frame by inverting the pose (un-transform)
% 3. Keyframes are selected, outliers are filtered per cloud
% 4. Attitude is realigned to gravity (floor) and yaw (walls)
% 5. A pose graph is built with ONLY sequential + gravity constraints
% 6. It is optimized and the map is reconstructed with the corrected poses
