"""Octree spatial subdivision of a point cloud.

The root is the cubic bounding box of the cloud. Each node is split into 8
octants; only *occupied* octants (those containing points) are created, and
subdivision stops at `max_depth`. The occupied leaves at depth d are the same
voxels the fast voxelizer produces at edge = root_extent / 2**d — octree.py is
the explicit hierarchical structure (useful for reporting per-level node counts
and for understanding the sampling), while voxelizer.py is the fast path used
by the interactive viewer.
