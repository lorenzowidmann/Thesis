"""Metric size of a masked region, measured from the LiDAR scan of that frame.

Why this now exists at stage 1
------------------------------
geometry.py's original header says, correctly, that a metric gate on a WINDOW
mask cannot work: glazing returns nothing, and a window mask spans a
foreground mullion and a background seen through the glass, so
`pixel_height * median_depth / fy` measured 2.4-3.2 m for ordinary openings.

None of that argument applies to a DOOR. A door leaf is opaque, it is one
surface at one depth, and the LiDAR hits it. The pixel rules that decide
whether a door candidate survives -- minimum width, floor contact, "not taller
than a glazed wall" -- are all depth-dependent thresholds masquerading as
constants: the same door at 4 m and at 12 m differs by 3x in pixels. That is
why a real door at the far end of the corridor is 87 px tall and gets thrown
out by a rule written for one 5 m away.

So the LiDAR is consulted BEFORE a door candidate is discarded, and only for
doors. What it can do:

  * RESCUE a candidate a pixel rule wants to kill, when the metric size is
    door-like.
  * REJECT a candidate the pixel rules would have kept, when the metric size
    is definitively not door-like.
  * ABSTAIN, which is the common case and the important one. Too few points,
    or points spread over too many depths, means there is no measurement --
    and no measurement must never be read as a failed measurement. The pixel
    rules then decide alone, exactly as before.

The depth-spread guard is what makes abstention honest. A mask that straddles
a near mullion and a far wall has a bimodal depth histogram, and its median is
a number that describes no surface at all; `nearest_clouds_for_targets` will
happily hand one over. p95/p05 > `max_depth_ratio` is the check, and it is the
same failure the README documents for the densified-depth experiment (a
4.8-17.5 m region reporting a 4.4 m median).

Venv note: this module imports rosbags, so stage 1 now needs it too. It is
imported lazily, from load_clouds() only, so a run without --bag stays on the
old torch-only dependency set.

    frame. Both window bays fall outside it and collect ZERO returns even
    inside their bounding boxes, so no window voxel can exist regardless of
    what stage 1 decided. On the raw cloud the same bays get ~5 800 returns

    The poses are FAST-LIO's either way -- this changes which POINTS are
    carried, not where the rig thought it was. If the crop damaged the
