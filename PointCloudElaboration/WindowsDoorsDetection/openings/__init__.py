"""Door/window/other classification of image segments.

Import policy, copied from EmissivityCalculation's hard-won one: this
__init__ pulls in classifier.py, which imports torch. The consensus stage
runs under the rosbags venv (no torch), so it imports openings.table and
openings.zone_prior as plain modules by path instead of through the package
-- both of those are stdlib-only on purpose. Keep them that way.
