"""The door/window/other class list and its ADE20K mapping, loaded from
opening_table.csv.

Same role EmissivityCalculation/emissivity/table.py plays for materials: the
taxonomy lives in the file, so a change (door_open/door_closed,
window_shutter, ...) is a CSV edit, not a code edit.

Columns
-------
class   the class name segments.json and the consensus stage use
ade     the ADE20K-150 label Mask2Former must emit for a region to become this
        class, matched on the first comma-separated synonym, lowercased.
        Blank means "no ADE class maps here" -- which is correct for `other`,
        the catch-all every unmapped ADE label falls into.
prompt  the CLIP prompt. DEAD as of the Mask2Former switch: stage 1 no longer
        runs a zero-shot classifier. Kept because the column documents what
        each class means, and because openings/classifier.py still reads it if
        anyone wants to run the old path for comparison.
notes   free text.

Two deliberate differences from EmissivityTable:

  * stdlib csv, not pandas. voxel-consensus runs under the rosbags venv
    (no pandas, no torch -- see EmissivityCalculation/voxel_consensus.py's
    header), and it needs the class list to pool votes. Keeping this module
    dependency-free means both stages import the same file.

  * class names must be UNIQUE. There is no multi-prompt-per-class pooling;
    one row is one class is one prompt. Duplicate rows raise rather than
    silently letting the last one win.
