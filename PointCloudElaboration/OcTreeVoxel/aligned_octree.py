"""Level the raw point cloud against the closed wall/floor/ceiling box from
fit_closed_planes.py, then octree-voxelize the now axis-aligned cloud.

Generalizes the gravity-leveling rotation in De Pazzi, Chiodini, Pertile
(Sensors 2022), "3D Radiometric Mapping by Means of LiDAR SLAM and Thermal
Camera Data Fusion" (Sec. 4.2, Eq. 14) from one ground-plane tilt correction
to a full 3-axis "building frame": the floor plane's normal gives the up
axis, the dominant wall pair's normal gives a second axis, and their cross
product gives the third. Applying that rigid transform to the whole raw
cloud turns the corridor's real SLAM-frame yaw into a Manhattan-aligned box,
so the octree's voxel grid comes out straight -- purely because the input
points were pre-aligned here, not because octree.py/voxelizer.py know
anything about planes.

The planes are used ONLY to compute the alignment transform. Every point in
the bag is loaded and transformed -- nothing is clipped or dropped based on
plane membership. The octree step itself follows the paper's actual method:
one root bin encompassing all points, recursively subdivided into 8 occupied
children per level (build_octree, octree/octree.py).

No temperature/thermal averaging per voxel here -- geometry/alignment only.

Usage:
    python aligned_octree.py [--planes planes.json]
        [--bag <rosbag2_folder>] [--topic /cloud_registered] [--store ROS2_HUMBLE]
        [--depth 8] | [--voxel-size 0.15]
        [--voxels-out voxels.npz] [--transform-out transform.json]
        [--planes-aligned-out planes_aligned.json]

Also writes planes_aligned.json: the closed box re-derived *in* the aligned
frame (align_and_reclose_planes), not just planes.json's corners rotated by
the transform -- see that function's docstring for why the naive rotation
leaves a small residual tilt. view_voxels.py overlays this file.

Venv: C:\\venvs\\planefit (same as fit_closed_planes.py -- rosbags is enough
for this script, but it shares the venv for convenience).

    planes by axis_of() = argmax(abs(normal)) and stretches each rectangle to

    real ~2.6 deg yaw correction, so an edge that was "already" treated as
    X-aligned pre-rotation comes out with a small but visible Y/Z component
