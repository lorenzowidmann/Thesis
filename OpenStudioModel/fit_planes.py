"""RANSAC plane fitting on the dense accumulated LiDAR point cloud.

Standalone geometry step: loads /cloud_registered from a rosbag2, merges all
frames (points are already in world/map frame -- no transform needed), applies
an optional ROI crop + Statistical Outlier Removal + declutter (same
options/defaults as PointCloudElaboration/PointCloudView/view_pointcloud.py),
then iteratively RANSAC-fits planes with open3d (pcd.segment_plane). For each
accepted plane, its inlier points are trimmed to their largest connected 2D
patch (drops stray far-away inliers, e.g. points seen through a doorway/window
that happen to lie on the same plane) and fit with an oriented minimum-area
rectangle (cv2.minAreaRect) -- a simple rectangular patch per plane, not a
general polygon.

No thermal data, no wall/floor/ceiling labeling, no OpenStudio -- pure
LiDAR geometry.

Usage:
    python fit_planes.py --bag <rosbag2_folder>
        [--topic /cloud_registered]

        [--out planes.json]

--declutter is the "automatic ROI": instead of a manual bounding box, it
drops points not connected to the main body (points outside the hall), the
same logic view_pointcloud.py uses. --rect-cluster-gap does the equivalent
trim per-plane, so a handful of stray inliers can't stretch a plane's
rectangle far beyond its real extent. --max-tilt-deg rejects candidate
planes whose normal isn't close to vertical (floor/ceiling) or horizontal
(wall) -- i.e. not aligned with the real building structure, like a
diagonal plane fit through noise -- and discards those points as noise
instead of returning them as a plane (0 = accept any orientation).

Occlusion/clutter/gaps often make RANSAC fit one physical floor/wall/ceiling
as several disjoint fragments. Dedupe (on by default) groups planes with
near-parallel normals and near-identical offset -- the same physical surface
-- and keeps only the largest (by inlier_count), dropping the redundant
fragments. --no-dedupe keeps every fragment as its own plane.

--snap-axis forces every accepted plane's normal onto the nearest world axis
(+-X, +-Y, +-Z), so tilt_deg is exactly 0 and all rectangles come out
perfectly Manhattan-aligned, instead of each carrying its own few degrees of
RANSAC noise.

--close-geometry goes one step further: independently axis-aligned rectangles
still don't share edges (each stops wherever its own inliers ended), so the
result isn't watertight and can't be imported to OpenStudio. It keeps only
the single largest plane per side per axis (X/Y/Z) and stretches each kept
rectangle to the shared bounding box, producing one closed 6(-ish)-face box.
